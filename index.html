    <h1> Welcome to Dune </h1>
    <h2> I must not fear. </h2>
    <p> Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. </p>
    <h2> I will face my fear. </h2>
    <p> I will permit it to pass over and through me. </p>
    <h2> And when it has gone past </h2>
    <p> I will turn the inner eye to see its path. </p>
    <p> Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. </p>
    <p> Only I will remain. </p>
