    <h2><strong>Litany against Fear</strong></h2>
    <h2> I must not fear. </h2>
    <p> Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. </p>
    <h2> I will face my fear. </h2>
    <p> I will permit it to pass over and through me. </p>
    <h2> And when it has gone past </h2>
    <p> I will turn the inner eye to see its path. </p>
    <p> Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. </p>
    <p> Only I will remain. </p>


    <h1>The Story of Sleepy Dogs Production</h1>
    <p>Sleepy Dog Productions is a leader in the movement to teach <br>
      technical sophistication in the realm of <em>story-telling</em>––the seemingly magical ability to take <br>
      command of your perspective, following a character's life and follow your dreams. <br>

      Creative decision making lies at the core of great filmmaking. <br>
      To shoot a movie, you need to understand how the equipment works, <br>
      but more importantly, you need to know how the choices you make—composition, <br>
      exposure, lighting, etc.—impact the way the audience sees the film. <br>
      The Cinematography series with Bill Dill covers the basics you need to shoot a modern motion picture <br>
      and tell stories in the most powerful way possible. Part 1 concentrates on narrative filmmaking: <br>
      creating a world from scratch, using a storyboard and a script. <br>

      This includes everything from

      Follow along and learn the fundamentals required to shoot a story with a camera. <br>
      Learn how to plan your production, assemble a crew, choose the right camera and lenses, <br>
      and make creative choices that best fit the themes, characters, and story of your film. <br>
      We covers the elements of composition, exposure, optics, lighting, and camera movement. <br>
      Part 2 shows you how to put all these ideas together on set, and deliver the footage <br>
      to an editor and director for assembly into a complete, coherent, and compelling story. <br>

      We believe there are <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em> who can benefit from
      learning «the art of story-telling», probably more. <br>
