        <h1>The Story of Sleepy Dogs Production</h1>

        <p>Sleepy Dog Productions is a leader in the movement to teach
          technical sophistication in the realm of <em>story-telling</em>––the seemingly magical ability to take
          command of your perspective, following a character's life and follow your dreams.

          Creative decision making lies at the core of great filmmaking.
          To shoot a movie, you need to understand how the equipment works,
          but more importantly, you need to know how the choices you make—composition,
          exposure, lighting, etc.—impact the way the audience sees the film.
          The Cinematography series with Bill Dill covers the basics you need to shoot a modern motion picture
          and tell stories in the most powerful way possible. Part 1 concentrates on narrative filmmaking:
          creating a world from scratch, using a storyboard and a script.



          Follow along and learn the fundamentals required to shoot a story with a camera.
          Learn how to plan your production, assemble a crew, choose the right camera and lenses,
          and make creative choices that best fit the themes, characters, and story of your film.
          We covers the elements of composition, exposure, optics, lighting, and camera movement.
          Part 2 shows you how to put all these ideas together on set, and deliver the footage
          to an editor and director for assembly into a complete, coherent, and compelling story.

          We believe there are <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em> who can benefit from
          learning «the art of story-telling», probably more. <br>

    <h2><strong>Litany against Fear</strong></h2>
        <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;">


        <h3> I must not fear. </h3>
        <p> Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. </p>
        <h3> I will face my fear. </h3>
        <p> I will permit it to pass over and through me. </p>
        <h3> And when it has gone past </h3>
        <p> I will turn the inner eye to see its path. </p>
        <p> Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. </p>
        <p> Only I will remain. </p>
